```{r}

x = t.test(rnorm(10))
x
names(x)
x$conf.int
```

```{r}
f=function(t){x=t.test(rnorm(t));as.vector(x$conf.int)};
f(10);
f(20);
t <- as.matrix(rep(10,100));
C <- t(apply(t,1,f)); #this is a trick so we don't have to program
matplot(C,type="l"); #a matrix plot
abline(0,0) #includes a line at 0
```

```{r}

num = (C[, 1] < 0) & (C[, 2] > 0)
sum(num)/nrow(C)
```
