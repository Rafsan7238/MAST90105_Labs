Taking help from RStudio for unknown formula:

```{r}
?dnorm
```

Creating variables:

```{r}
a<-1
b = 2
```

Creating vectors:

```{r}
b = c(1,2,3)
c = 1:3
d = seq(1,5,0.5)
e = rep(3,7)
```

Arithmetic operations:

```{r}
1*2*3
1/2/3
2**3
2^1.5
log(12)
exp(1)
pi
4*atan(1)
```

Concatenate vectors:

```{r}
ab = c(a,b)
```

Vector mathematics:

```{r}
2*b
b^2
sin(b)
```
